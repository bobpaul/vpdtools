BiasClock requires the following external programs to run:

pflash (from skiboot)
attributeOverride (from hostboot)

To adjust clocks:
./biasclock

NOTE
If the overclock is unstable, your system may not complete IPL.  On the BMC, the following command will clear the bias and restore original clocks on the next IPL cycle:
pflash -P ATTR_TMP -c
